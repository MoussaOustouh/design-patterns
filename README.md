# Gangs of Four (GoF) Design Patterns

Gangs of Four Design Patterns is the collection of 23 design patterns from the book [Design Patterns: Elements of Reusable Object-Oriented Software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Design_Patterns).



## GoF Design Pattern Types

GoF Design Patterns are divided into three categories:
    
1. **Creational**: The design patterns that deal with the creation of an object.
2. **Structural**: The design patterns in this category deals with the class structure such as Inheritance and Composition.
3. **Behavioral**: This type of design patterns provide solution for the better interaction between objects, how to provide lose coupling, and flexibility to extend easily in the future.

## Creational Design Patterns

* ### **Singleton**
The singleton pattern restricts the initialization of a class to ensure that only one instance of the class can be created.

Approaches of Singleton pattern implementation:
1. Eager initialization
2. Static block initialization
3. Lazy Initialization
4. Thread Safe Singleton
5. Bill Pugh Singleton Implementation
6. Using Reflection to destroy Singleton Pattern
7. Enum Singleton
8. Serialization and Singleton

* ### **Factory Method**
In object-oriented programming (OOP), a factory is an object for creating other objects.\
This pattern takes out the responsibility of creating objects without exposing the creation logic to the client.


* ### **Abstract Factory**
Allows us to create a Factory for factory classes.
